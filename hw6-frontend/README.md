     Good UI Design, user-friendly with clear hint;

   * Improvement

     The "Remember me" check box doesn't work;

     Post and Clear button not in the same line, there seems something wrong with the CSS;

     The comment button can only review the comments and there is no way to leave a comment;

     After I unfollow John, I cannot add John to the following list again.

     It may be better if the error messages only displayed when user input some invalid information;

     The icon and the upload button has the same function but the upload post button doesn't work,;

     Search function also seems cannot work;

     In the profile page, user must update all the fields at the same time.

     Good UI design

   - Improvement

     When clicking on the Older button, the page redirect to the login page, it's a little wired;

     Don't know who leave the comments, can add such information;

     Refreshing the page, it redirects to an empty page;

     It would be better if not use the alert to show warning information;

     The layout of Profile page can be improved;

     Easy to follow

   - Improvement

     I think it may be better not using the art word, it makes the word not so clear;

     It would be better to change the seperator between two posts, not use ".";

     Some "Close comments" buttons don't work;

     When search by the content, the search function doesn't work;

     The font size of comments is the same as or smaller than that of the post content will be better;

     The profile page can hide the information of password.
